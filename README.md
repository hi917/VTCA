<h1>VTCA - Virginia Tech Course Alerter</h1>
<p>
A web application which allows you to select Virginia Tech courses to "listen" to.
Whenever there is an opening for the course(s) you are listening to, a new browser window will open to
alert you of an available spot.

Remaining plans:
1. Utilize <a href="https://github.com/chishui/JSSoup">JSSoup</a> to create an API like 
<a href="https://github.com/VirginiaTech/pyvt">pyvt</a>, but for javascript.
2. Implement course lookup using newly created API
3. Implement interval course availability checking system
