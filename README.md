<h1>VTCA - Virginia Tech Course Alerter</h1>
<p>
A web application which allows you to create a .txt file containing Virginia Tech courses you select. The generated .txt file can be used with the provided python script (listen.py) to create a desktop alert when there is an availability in a course. The checking interval can be modified (default of 10 seconds).

  Well known service for notifying Virginia Tech students about course openings. Less work required to setup compared to my alternative. However, non-premium notifications are delayed 5-10 minutes. That information along with unknown opening checking intervals, may result in missed opportunities.

  Similar to Course Pickle. Differences are Coursicle supports text messaging by default, but requires payment for adding multiple classes to listen to. Opening checking intervals are unknown to me.

  Great alternative for notifying course openings. Utilizes Pushbullet to send notifications to all devices. My previous experiences with Pushbullet showed that the notifications were delayed, however this was just my experience (and I used it some time ago). All you need is Python installed.
