<h1>VTCA - Virginia Tech Course Alerter</h1>
<p>
A web application which allows you to select Virginia Tech courses to "listen" to.
Whenever there is an opening for the course(s) you are listening to, a new browser window will open to
alert you of an available spot.

Remaining plans:
1. Determine javascript web scraping technology.
2. Implement interval course availability checking system
